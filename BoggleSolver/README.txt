THIS PROGRAM IS GIVEN AS-IS. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS PROVIDED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, DIRECT OR INDIRECT, CAUSED BY USING THIS SOFTWARE.

This program was written using Visual C# Express 2010. Feel free to open it and look at (and change) the source code if you like.

To run, just run the BoggleSolver.exe file in the bin/release folder.
To change the dictionary, edit the dictionary.txt file in the same folder (follow the conventions).
The grid is found in the inputs.txt file, so you must edit that file to change the inputs.
